You can change the number "3" to any number you like and the commands will be repeatd as many times as the number you placed inside the repeat block. For example, if you use repeat "2" times and inside the repeat block you place the move right block, then <span class="spanPlayerName" style="color: white;"></span> will move 2 stars to the right (200pixels).</p>

					<p>- <span style="color: blue;"><b>if (condition)</b></span> (<img src="assets/if.png" alt="Star" height="40" width="60">). We learned that conditions can be either true or false. If the condition is true then the blocks you put inside the "if" block are executed once without repeating. If you put an "if" block inside a "repeat" block then the "if" block will be executed as many times as your repeat block. </p>
					<p>- <span style="color: blue;"><b>star has:"option" color</b></span> (<img src="assets/starHasColor.png" alt="Star" height="30" width="120">). This is the <b>condition</b> of your "if" block. With this block you can check if <span class="spanPlayerName" style="color: white;"></span> steps on a red (or green or blue) star. If <span class="spanPlayerName" style="color: white;"></span> steps on the color you selected then the condition of "if" block becomes true and the blocks you have putted inside it are executed.</p>
					<p>- <span style="color: blue;"><b>collect "option" star</b></span> (<img src="assets/collectColorStar.png" alt="Star" height="30" width="120">). With this block you can tell <span class="spanPlayerName" style="color: white;"></span> to collect the color you selected. <span class="spanPlayerName" style="color: white;"></span> must be on top of the colorful star in order to be collected. Collecting colorful stars is hard and thats why you tell the adventurer to collect the colorful star at the right time only. Otherwise you will waste a large amount of time.</p>

					<p>- <span style="color: blue;"><b>if (condition) else if (condition) else</b></span> (<img src="assets/ifElseIf.png" alt="Star" height="100" width="150">). At Level 6 you learned how a simple "if" block works. Now it is time to create an <b>"else if"</b> control. If you check your "if" block you will see a little button (<img src="assets/settingsIf.png" alt="Star" height="20" width="20">) on it. This button will help you expand your simple if block and check for more conditions. In our game there are 3 rare colorful types of stars (red, gree, blue). Whenever the adventurer steps on a colorful rare star you have to check what color it is inside your "if" or "else if" condition and if the condition is true you will have to tell <span class="spanPlayerName" style="color: white;"></span> to collect the right colorful star. <span class="spanPlayerName" style="color: white;"></span> will start by checking the first condition of your "if-else" block. If your first condition is true then <span class="spanPlayerName" style="color: white;"></span> will execute the command blocks you putted inside it and ingore the rest of the "else if" conditions. On the other hand if your first condition is false, then <span class="spanPlayerName" style="color: white;"></span> will look at the second "else if" condition and so on.</p>

					<p>- <span style="color: blue;"><b>if (condition) inside an if (condition)</b></span> (<img src="assets/ifInsideIf.png" alt="Star" height="100" width="200">). When you place an "if" block inside an "if" block as the previous image shows, then the second "if" block is called <b>Nested if</b>. When you use 2 "if" blocks inside each other then you can check two conditions and if those conditions are true you can execute the blocks you put inside the do area. In our image example the first condition checks if <span class="spanPlayerName" style="color: white;"></span> is on top of a red star. If <span class="spanPlayerName" style="color: white;"></span> stands on top of a red star then the codition is true and then checks for the "Nested if" condition, which sees if the colorful star that the adventurer stands on has a balloon. The balloons have the same color as the stars beneath them.</p>

					<p>- <span style="color: blue;"><b>star has balloon on top</b></span> (<img src="assets/starHasBalloon.png" alt="Star" height="25" width="150">). With this block you can check if the star <span class="spanPlayerName" style="color: white;"></span> stands on has a balloon on top of it. <span style="color: blue;font-size: 30px;">Important: You should always collect the balloon first and then collect the star. Otherwise if you collect the star first and then check if the star has a balloon on top of it, <span class="spanPlayerName" style="color: white;"></span> will get confused and forget that there was a star there.</span></p>
					
					<p>- <span style="color: blue;"><b>jump and collect option balloon</b></span> (<img src="assets/collectBalloon.png" alt="Star" height="25" width="150">).

					<h2>Level 9 - Method</h2>
					
					<p><span style="color: blue;"><b>Methods: </b></span></p>
					<p>This level will help you understand how methods work. In our game every time you step on a star you wann check the color of it, then check if it has a balloon on top of it, if it has a balloon collect it and then collect the star. You have to repeat those steps every time you see many colorful stars next to each other. Here is where a method can help you. When you wann repeat the same actions again and again, in our case check for stars and balloons, you can create a method and put inside it all those actions. For example you can create a method with a name "check for balloons and stars" and inside it make all those checks we described earlier. When your method is ready use the "call method" block under the start block and the the right potition.</p>
					<br>
					
					<p><span style="color: blue;"><b>New Blocks: </b></span></p>
					<p>- <span style="color: blue;"><b>Method name: "you name it"</b></span> (<img src="assets/method.png" alt="Star" height="40" width="200">). Drag and drop a method block inside your Blockly Area. Do not connect this block with the Start block. Give a name to your method and inside it place any blocks you like. Those block wont be executed by <span class="spanPlayerName" style="color: white;"></span> unless you call that method with a "call method" block and connect that block under the Start block</p>
					
					<p>- <span style="color: blue;"><b>call method</b></span> (<img src="assets/callMethod.png" alt="Star" height="25" width="100">). With this block you call the method with that name and tell <span class="spanPlayerName" style="color: white;"></span></span> to execute all the blocks you have putted inside that method. In order to create a call method block, select the method you created, right click on it and then click on the 'create "your method's name"' option.</p>
					<img src="assets/howToCreateCallMethod.png" alt="Star" height="150" width="250">
					<br>
					<p>At the example bellow you can see a method created with the name "how to move", which moves the adventurer one time to the right. Then under the Start block we call that method with the help of the call method block "how to move".</p>
